# Journal

Written as a first attempt of a web-based project in Go, this is a simple web-
server driven blog with the ability to post new entries.

It makes use of a SQLite database to store the journal entries.

## Remaining Items

* Form for submitting new entries (at /new)
* Store new entries
* Display entries on index
* Display individual entry
